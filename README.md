## How It Works

The program takes various values from the user and calculates results for different types of values.

Step 1: Income

The user should enter income they receive for each income type at the prompt.
These include Rental, Laundry, Storage, and Misc (vending machine?).
Any income not explicitly listed can be added in Misc.

This gets calculated as Total Monthly Income.

Step 2: Expenses

Next, the program will run the user through a long list of expenses. These include:
Taxes, Insurance, Utilities (Electric, Water, etc), HOA Fees, Lawncare/Snow removal aka Groundskeeping,
Vacancy (This is an estimated 2-5% of the yearly rental income, reserved for when the property is vacant),
Repairs, Capital Expenditure (CapEx: aka savings amount for large repairs such as new roof, floor, etc.),
Property Management (Usually a person or company who manages the tenants, issues on site, etc.), 
and last but not least, Mortgage.

This gets calcuated as Total Monthly Expenses.

Step 3: Cash Flow

Now, the program takes the saved Income and subtracts the user's saved Expenses.

This gets calculated as Total Monthly Cashflow.

Step 4: Cash on Cash RoI

Next, the program will ask for the user's investment amounts. These include:
Down Payment, Closing Costs, Rehab/Renovation Budget, and Misc Other.

This gets calculated as the Total investment.

Finally, the program calculates the Cash on Cash RoI by dividing the annual cash flow by the total investment.
The result is a percentage.
